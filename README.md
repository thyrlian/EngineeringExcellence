# Engineering Excellence

How to achieve **Engineering Excellence**? There is no out-of-the-box methodology, since engineering excellence is an attitude, it's characterised by a relentless pursuit of engineering excellence. Though here provides you a handy checklist, do keep in mind: to maintain a mindset of engineering excellence, you need to make it a force of habit.

* For any software project, always create **a script to bootstrap the project** without human intervention.

* Document is the default go-to person. When documenting, you should log as much as possible, including/especially the **business context** (to make such decision), and the **business impact**. It has several advantages:

  - Asynchronous communication
  
  - Full text search
  
  - Track changes
  
  - Nonfragmentary

* SDLC includes the phase of **collecting feedback** - from prototype stakeholders, or beta users, or customers.

* **Automate** as much as possible:

  - Less expensive
  
  - Fewer mistakes

* Enable **IaC** (Infrastructure as Code) and/or **CaC** (Configuration as Code) or **GitOps**:

  - Decoupled
  
  - Persistent
  
  - Track of changes
  
  - Explanatory contextual comments
  
  - Revertable
  
  - Deployable
